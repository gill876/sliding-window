## Decrementing Sliding Window in Java

### Why I'm creating this

I was doing this coding test but fumbled and couldn't figure out how to implement a decrementing sliding window in Java. This component was crucial for the assignment.

Also, I couldn't find any reference online, so I'd like to leave this here for anyone who'd like to leverage it.
