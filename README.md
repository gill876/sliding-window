### Why I'm creating this

I was doing this coding test but fumbled and couldn't figure out how to implement a decrementing sliding window in Java.
This component was crucial for the assignment (I can't disclose the full content of the task though).

Also, I couldn't find any reference online, so I'd like to leave this here for anyone who'd like to leverage it.

### How it works

The first window generated by the algorithm will be of the same size as reference_string. Afterwards, the window size will decrement by 1 and slide across reference_string.
The algorithm will iterate by sliding the window across reference_string by each character, then shrink the window by 1 until its size reaches 2.

### Main code

[`src/main/java/com/example/Main.java`](src/main/java/com/example/Main.java)
```java
    public static String[] decrementingSlidingWindow(String reference_string) {
        int reference_string_length = reference_string.length();
        int window_start = 0;
        int window_end = reference_string.length();
        int window_size = window_end - window_start;

        ArrayList<String> output = new ArrayList<>();

        while (window_size > 1) {
            while (reference_string_length >= window_start + window_size) {
                String window_value = reference_string.substring(window_start, window_start + window_size);

                output.add(window_value); // You can do whatever here. I chose to save the window here

                window_start++; // Move the window across relative to reference_string
            }
            window_size--;
            window_start = 0; // Reset relative to reference_string by moving the window to the start
        }

        return output.toArray(new String[0]);
    }
```
